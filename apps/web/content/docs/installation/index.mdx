# Installation

better-auth-ui components can be installed using two methods, each with its own advantages. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Installation Methods

| Method          | Command                               | Best For                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **shadcn CLI**  | `npx shadcn@latest add "URL"`         | Full customization, source code ownership |
| **NPM Package** | `pnpm add @better-auth-ui/components` | Managed updates, quick setup              |

### shadcn CLI (Recommended for Customization)

Copy the component source code directly into your project. You own the code and can customize everything.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://better-auth-ui.com/r/credential-login"
```

**Pros:**

- Full control over styling and behavior
- No external dependencies to update
- Easy to modify for specific needs

**Cons:**

- Manual updates when upstream changes
- Larger initial setup

### NPM Package (Recommended for Quick Setup)

Install as a dependency with automatic updates via your package manager.

```bash
pnpm add @better-auth-ui/components
```

**Pros:**

- Quick setup (under 5 minutes)
- Automatic updates with `pnpm update`
- Smaller bundle size (tree-shaking)

**Cons:**

- Limited customization (prop-based only)
- External dependency

  authClient={authClient}
  showRememberMe={true}
  onSuccess={() => router.push("/dashboard")}
